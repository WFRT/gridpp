The program post-processes an AROME or ECMWF NetCDF file by using various
downscaling and calibration methods. Post-processed forecasts are placed in a
second Netcdf file, which has the desired output grid.

To convert between the two grids, a downscaling method is used. Currently
implemented methods are:

* nearest neighbour

* elevation gradient (interpolation to new elevations using gradients)

* smart neighbours (nearest grid points at the same elevation)

* pressure (interpolation to new elevations using a standard atmosphere)

Calibrators include:

* spatial smoothing (average within a neighbourhood)

* ensemble calibration of precipitation using zero-adjusted Gamma distribution

* polynomial regression of any order

* calculation of precipitation phase, using wetbulb temperature

* calculation of QNH from surface pressure




Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. Ensure the following libraries are installed:

   * Boost libraries
   * Netcdf c++ library
   * (Optional) Google test library (if developing new code)

2. Edit CC, CFLAGS_O, IFLAGS, and LFLAGS in makefile

3. Run 'make'



Running the program
-------------------
To see program options, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./gridpp

To test the program on a fake dataset, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./gridpp testing/files/10x10.nc testing/files/10x10_copy.nc -v T -d gradient -v Precip -d smart numSmart=3 searchRadius=3
   ncview testing/files/10x10_copy.nc



Example
-------
To test the program on a real operational AROME file, follow these steps:

1. Make a copy of a file to post-process:

.. code-block:: bash

   cp /starc/DNMI_AROME_METCOOP/2015/01/01/AROME_MetCoOp_00_DEF.nc_20150101 localcopy.nc

2. Create a smoothed precipitation field in localcopy.nc:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./gridpp /starc/DNMI_AROME_METCOOP/2015/01/01/AROME_MetCoOp_00_DEF.nc_20150101 localcopy.nc -v Precip -c smooth smoothRadius=10



Running on multiple cores
-------------------------
To run using 8 threads:

.. code-block:: bash

   export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8
   ./gridpp ...



Minimizing memory usage
-----------------------
Run the program in sequence for each variable:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./gridpp input output -v T ...
   ./gridpp input output -v Precip ...
   ./gridpp input output -v RH ...
